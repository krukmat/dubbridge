"""Pure W3 authority-boundary classifier (NOT an authorization verifier).

The result classifies the need for a human authorization ceremony. It never
certifies that the caller may execute, and it never accepts a caller-asserted
'approved' flag as proof of a valid HAA grant or DubBridge AuthorityLease.

Runners must preserve their existing RRI/HITL, scope, and evidence gates until
W3.3–W3.5 attach actual HAA authorization and verify live resource state.
